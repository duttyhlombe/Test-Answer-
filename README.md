# Test-Answer-
The test is as followed: Develop a responsive front-end section layout that has 6 items that are structured as 2 rows and 3 columns. The 6 items of data need to be pulled from any API call of your choice. Each item on click needs to show a modal popup to display more fields from that particular item data entry in detail.

# Responsive Front-End Section Layout with Modals

This is a simple front-end layout that demonstrates a responsive 2-row, 3-column grid layout. The content of each grid item is pulled from the JSONPlaceholder API and displayed in a modal popup upon clicking on the item.

## Instructions:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. The grid layout with 6 items will be displayed, and upon clicking any item, a modal popup will appear with more details about that item.

## Dependencies:

- No external dependencies are required for this project.

## API Endpoint:

The data for the grid items is fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API, which provides a free fake online REST API for testing and prototyping. The API endpoint used in this project is `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`.

Please ensure you have an internet connection or that the API is accessible for the data to be fetched successfully.

## Credits:

- The responsive layout and modal functionality were developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
